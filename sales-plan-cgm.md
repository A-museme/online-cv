### **Expanded Improvement Plan: Leadership & Collaborative Change**

**One-on-One Meetings**:  
I'll continue regular individual meetings with team members, providing a platform for their feedback and ensuring they feel supported. These meetings will help me identify personal pain points and opportunities for development.

**Weekly Sales Meetings**:  
Starting in week 2, I'll introduce weekly sales meetings to build on existing efforts and give the sales team an opportunity to share input before we make any changes. My goal is to emphasize collaboration and transparency, ensuring the team feels they're part of the improvement process.

**Leadership & Change Management**:  
My leadership approach focuses on empowering the sales team while guiding necessary changes. I'll position myself as both a leader and a peer working alongside them, so the team knows I'm here to support them. At the same time, I'll expect them to push for new opportunities and embrace the efficient model we'll implement together.

**Remote Team Management**:  
Given that this is a remote team, I'll leverage my extensive experience in managing remote teams to implement structured systems for tracking KPIs, tasks, and overall progress. I'll ensure leadership has access to real-time data on who's working on what, for how long, and how effectively.

**Data-Driven Insights**:  
- We'll start collecting customer acquisition cost data early on and use it to align our future strategies.
- I'll organize sales training, including role-playing and call reviews, to boost confidence and improve team productivity.
- We'll use data extraction tools for recorded sales meetings to capture insights that will drive improvements and guide our team to higher conversion rates.

**Incentive Programs and "Sales Sprints"**:  
I plan to introduce incentive programs to foster healthy competition and motivation, with a special focus on what I call "Sales Sprints". These will be timed challenges aimed at improving performance in key areas like lead generation, appointment setting, or conversions.
